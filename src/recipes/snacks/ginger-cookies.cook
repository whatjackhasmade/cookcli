In a large bowl, whisk together @olive oil{3 tbsp} and @ground turmeric{½ tsp} until combined. Let sit for about 30 seconds to let turmeric dissolve. Add @granulated sugar{150 grams}, @lemon zest{2 whole lemons}, room temperature @cream cheese{114g}, room temperature @egg{1 large}, and @vanilla extract{1 tsp}. Vigorously whisk to combine and aerate the mixture, about 1 minute.

Whisk in @baking soda{¾ tsp} and @salt{½ tsp}. Add @all-purpose flour{192 grams}, then switch to a rubber spatula and stir to combine. Cover and refrigerate dough until hard enough to scoop, about 30 minutes and up to 24 hours.

Heat the oven to 350 degrees and line a couple of baking sheets with parchment. Using a 1½-tablespoon cookie scoop (or two spoons) and working one at a time, scoop out 1½-inch/29-gram rounds and coat them in @powdered sugar{92 grams}. Place them a couple of inches apart on the baking sheets and bake until crinkled and no longer wet-looking on top, 15 to 17 minutes. Let cool completely on the pan before eating.

Tips

To make ahead, prepare cookies up through Step 2, then scoop out 1½-tablespoon rounds and set them in a single layer in a resealable container. Freeze the dough, covered, for up to 1 month. When ready to bake, coat frozen dough balls in powdered sugar and bake, adding 1 to 2 minutes as needed. When measuring flour, be sure to scoop it into the measuring cup, then level it using the back of a butter knife.
