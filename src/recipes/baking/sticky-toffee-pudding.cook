Preheat the oven to 160°C/140°C fan. Grease a 20cm/8" round ovenproof dish.

In a stand mixer, beat @butter{125g} and @light muscovado sugar{150g} together until light and fluffy.

Gradually add @golden syrup{1 tbsp}, @black treacle{1 tbsp}, @eggs{2, large, free-range}, and @vanilla extract{1 tsp}, mixing continuously. Reduce speed and add @self-raising flour{150g}. Mix until combined.

In a saucepan, bring @water{250ml} to a simmer, then add @medjool dates{150g, chopped}. Cook for ~{2-3 minutes}, then stir in @bicarbonate soda{2 tsp} (it will foam up).

While hot, mix the date mixture into the flour mixture. Pour into the prepared dish and bake for ~{45-50 minutes}, until firm and slightly springy to touch.

Meanwhile, in a pan, melt @unsalted butter{100g}, @dark muscovado sugar{150g}, and @golden syrup{3 tbsp} over low heat until dissolved.

Stir in @double cream{150ml}, @vanilla extract{1 tsp}, and @sea salt{generous pinch}. Simmer for ~{3 minutes} until thickened, then remove from heat.

Drizzle the toffee sauce over the pudding and serve with vanilla ice cream.
